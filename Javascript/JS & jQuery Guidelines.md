## Types of Variables ##

Until ES5 there was only the reserve word `var`, since then, from ES6+ there's also `let` and `const`.

* `const` means that the identifier can't be reassigned, doesn't mean that's it's immutable.
* `let` allows the variable to be reassigned, and only allows access in the context, while `var` is a global variable, acessible everywhere in the program.
