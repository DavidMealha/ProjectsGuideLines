## Database First ##

## Code First ##

## Controllers ##

## Models ##

To define Views in ASP.NET MVC it's used a templating language called Razor, this way the views will not be decoupled from the server, leading to a higher relation(dependability) between Client and Server.

## ViewModels ##

## Authentication ##
Use Custom Authentication, with the use of FormsAuthentication that sets a cookie
